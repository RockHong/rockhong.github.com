Some tmux tips.

### Make Two Panes Take Full Screen Side by Side
Scenario: I have one tmux session with one window opening, in which five panes takes the window's screen.
I finish my coding and try to commit the code to git.
While submitting, I want to two panes occupy full tmux screen side by side -- one is for `git diff`,
the other is for `git add`.

Solution: Create a new temporary window. Use `join-pane` to move an existing pane into the new window.
Now two panes are side by side in the new window, do your `git diff` and `git add`.
When finish, use `join-pane` to move the pane back. And if you like, kill the newly created window.

All following commands should follow prefix key, `C-b`.

    # create a new temp window 
    c
    
    # list all panes in the session
    # you will find pane index in command output, like '0.0', 
    #   which means the first pane of the first window                       
    :list-panes -s     
    
    # move a pane into another pane
    # -h makes two pane position horizontally    
    # -s specifies source pane, -t for dest pane
    :join-pane -h -s 0.0 -t 1.0
    
    # do your job ...
    
    # move the pane back to previous window
    :join-pane -s 1.1 -t 0.0
    
    # kill the temp window
    :kill-window -t 1
