InfoQ has published a nice [mini book][1] on Java garbage collection. I
made a mind map from it for better understanding. (It turns out at last a mind map is not as much useful as I
thought, but at least I read the mini book once more during composing the mind
map.)

<!-- at least one blank line before <div>, <p>, <pre> or <table>,
and one blank after </div>.
but you can use <span>, <cite>, <del> freely -->
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/downloads/Java_GC.png">
  <img src="/images/blog/Java_GC-small.png" alt="java gc">
  </a>
</div>

This mind map is made on [coggle][3], a nice online mind mapping tool.
The source of this mind map can be found [here][2]. 

For people not working on garbage collection development, they may find the last two
chapters of the mini book more useful. InfoQ also has many [other articles](/tags/reading-list-tags.html#gc)
on Java GC, they're all worth reading.
