DOCTYPE <http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/guides/doctypes_and_markup_styles>
Why <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> is recommended? <http://www.html-5.com/tags/html-tag/index.html>
    It's always better to add namespace to avoid potential conflicts ;-)
"lang" attribute
    <http://reference.sitepoint.com/html/core-attributes/lang>
    The intention of the lang attribute is to allow browsers (and other user agents) to adjust their displays. For example, if you use the q element, a browser should be able to identify the language in use and present the appropriate style of quotation marks...Another example,The lang attribute is helpful to users of assistive technology such as screen readers that can adjust the pronunciation depending on the language used. For example, the word penchant, meaning .a strong and continued inclination,. is French in origin. When the screen reader JAWS encounters the word, it pronounces it similar to .pen-chunt,. but when the word is marked up as <span lang="fr">penchant</span>, JAWS reads it using the proper French pronunciation, .pon-shont..
